# Water Jug Problem
Water Jug Problem is a famous puzzle that has many variations. One of the most famous one is that you are given 3-gallon bucket, 4-gallon bucket and unlimited supply of water. You are allowed to empty and fill the buckets and pour from one to another one. How can you get exactly 2 gallons of water using the two buckets?

In case you haven't come up with the solution yet. Here it is. Let (bucket1, bucket2) be the amount of water in each bucket, then (0,0)->(0,4)->(3,1)->(0,1)->(1,0)->(1,4)->(3,2)->(0,2) to get 2 gallons in 4-gallon bucket.

That was easy, but what happens when you have m-gallon and n-gallon bucket?
